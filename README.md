# UART Communication Protocol on BASYS3

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a communication protocol called UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) between two BASYS3 boards. The main module is `UART_Device`, and it integrates four submodules: `buttonDebouncer`, `BCDToSevenSegment`, `TXBUF`, and `RXBUF`.

## Modules

### UART_Device

The `UART_Device` module is the top-level module that incorporates the functionality of all submodules to implement the UART communication protocol.

### buttonDebouncer

The `buttonDebouncer` module prevents button bounces. When a button is pressed, it can bounce due to physical properties, causing the input to fluctuate between 0 and 1. This fluctuation can result in multiple calls to a function when there should be only one. The `buttonDebouncer` module waits for 20000 clock cycles after the button is pressed and then captures the input value, effectively eliminating button bounces.

### BCDToSevenSegment

The `BCDToSevenSegment` module converts numerical outputs to a seven-segment display format. This conversion enables the activation of the seven-segment display in the UART module.

### TXBUF

The `TXBUF` module is responsible for transmitting data from one BASYS3 board to another. It operates through six states:

1. **idleState**: Resets counters and remains inactive.
2. **loadState**: Loads the data input as a complete message, including start bit, data bits, parity bit, and stop bit.
3. **loadWaitState**: Waits for the load button to return to 0 to prevent multiple loads, ensuring activation of the load state on a positive edge from 0 to 1.
4. **transmitState**: Sends the data bit by bit through a cable. If the auto-transfer switch is on, this state runs four times to send all loaded data.
5. **transmitWaitState**: Waits for the transmit enable input to return to 0, similar to `loadWaitState`, to prevent multiple transmissions.
6. **autoState**: Manages the auto-transfer process.

### RXBUF

The `RXBUF` module receives data sent from the other BASYS3 board. It operates through three states:

1. **idleState**: Waits for an input signal.
2. **receiveState**: Enters this state upon receiving a start bit (0). It balances the receiving frequency with the transmission frequency and stores each received bit in memory until the stop bit is detected.
3. **processState**: Checks the parity of the received message. If the message has an odd number of 1â€™s, it indicates an error during transmission and outputs 0. If the message is correct, it outputs the received message. After processing, the module returns to `idleState` to wait for a new message.

## Conclusion

This project successfully implements a UART communication protocol between two BASYS3 boards using the `UART_Device` module and its submodules. The system handles button debouncing, data conversion for seven-segment displays, data transmission, and data reception efficiently.
